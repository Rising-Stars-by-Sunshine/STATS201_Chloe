## Queried Data

### The Process
The provided R code outlines a data query process using the `censusapi` package to extract demographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS). First, the code installs and loads the `censusapi` package. An API key is then specified and inserted to authorize access to Census data. The query parameters, including the API endpoint (ACS in this case) and the desired variable (total population represented by "B01003_001E"), are defined. The geographic scope is set to a census tract within a specific state (New York, represented by the state code "36") and county (Kings County, represented by the county code "081"). The actual API call is made using the `getCensus` function, extracting the specified variables for the defined geography and vintage year (2019). The result, containing population data for the specified census tract, is stored in the variable `census_data`, which is then printed to display the retrieved information. This process demonstrates how to leverage the `censusapi` package to efficiently fetch demographic data from the U.S. Census Bureau's API for further analysis or visualization.

### The instructions:
Install and Load Census API Package:

Install the necessary package for interacting with the Census API.
Import or load the package in your script or environment.
Get API Key:

Obtain an API key from the U.S. Census Bureau's website to authorize access to Census data.
Set Query Parameters:

Define the API endpoint (e.g., ACS) and the specific variable you want to retrieve (e.g., total population represented by "B01003_001E").
Specify the geographic scope by providing details such as the state code (e.g., New York - "36") and county code (e.g., Kings County - "081").
Make API Call:

Use a function (e.g., getCensus in R) to make the API call.
Provide the defined query parameters, including the geography and vintage year (e.g., 2019).
Store and Display Results:

Store the retrieved data in a variable (e.g., census_data).
Print or display the variable to view the extracted information.
Adapt for Analysis or Visualization:

Use the fetched data (stored in census_data) for further analysis, visualization, or any other relevant tasks in your chosen programming language.

### The code
```{r}
# Install and load the censusapi package
install.packages("censusapi")
library(censusapi)

# Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual Census API key
api_key <- "YOUR_API_KEY"

# Specify the API endpoint and variables
endpoint <- "acs/acs5"
variables <- c("B01003_001E")  # B01003_001E represents total population

# Specify the geography (ZIP code in this example)
geo <- list(get = "tract", for = "block:*", in = "state:36+county:081")

# Make the API call
census_data <- getCensus(name = endpoint, vintage = 2019, key = api_key, vars = variables, geo = geo)

# Print the result
print(census_data)
```
