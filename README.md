+ Acknowledgements: I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Professor Luyao Zhang, who taught STATS 201: Machine Learning for Social Sciences. Professor Zhang's expertise, guidance, and passion for the subject matter greatly enriched my understanding of machine learning techniques and their applications in social sciences. The encouragement and support provided by Professor Zhang were invaluable throughout the course, fostering an environment of curiosity and intellectual growth. I would also like to extend my appreciation to Professor Markus Neumann, my instructor for SOSC 320: Applied Social Statistics. Professor Neumann's dedication to teaching and his clear, insightful explanations significantly contributed to my proficiency in applied statistical methods. The practical insights and real-world applications shared in the course were instrumental in enhancing my analytical skills and understanding of statistical approaches in social research.
+ Project Summary
  - Public transportation is a means of connecting us to where we need to be and whoever we need to see. It connects me to my job in the city or my sister in a different state. Public transportation is typically characterized as an accessible and affordable way of traveling from one destination to another. And, when we think of the United States of America, we think of the diverse terrain and people that come with their own unique needs and specifications. In a coastal city, it may be easier to travel via bridge or ferry, or for a person with a wheelchair to have a ramp access to a subway station. These little things make up public transportation in America. How can we analyze the little things, the social and environmental factors, that make up public transportation today to improve the system? This project seeks to use a Poisson regression analysis to determine the relationship between these factors and the choice of taking public transportation for those with disabilities. The main research question being; What are the complex relationships of social and environmental factors influencing the decision-making process of individuals with disabilities in participating in public transportation? And, how can we use this relationship to our advantage as urban planners? The main data sources include the ![United States Transportation Bureau](https://data.bts.gov/Research-and-Statistics/County-Transportation-Profiles/qdmf-cxm3) , the ![United States Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/table?q=disability&t=Transportation&tid=ACSSPP1Y2021.S020), and the ![UCLA Gerontology Study](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/PJWWOC). These scenarios I apply the social and environmental variables and their relationship through regression. Methodology involves a Poisson Regression model in R and a Quasi-Poisson model to verify my results. The results conclude that there is a significant relationship between infrastructure and the need for social interaction to motivate one’s decision to participate in public transportation. This model applies a new way of approaching data from the United States government as a means to improve urban planning by understanding relationships between decisions and various different factors. Urban planners and architects can take away from this research the important relationships to focus on when determining the use of space to increase the range of accessibility to more people.

### Bio:
hey all! I'm Chloe, junior undergraduate from Duke University and Duke Kunshan University where I study Computation and #Design/Urban Design. I spent a year at Duke in NC and a semester in Barcelona where I studied Architecture. 
I'm drawn to the relationship between urban planning/architecture and the natural environment and how it impacts the #people around it. All things aesthetics, urbanism, and accessibility.

### Resume:
+ Casa Río Research Assistant at Duke Kunshan Humanities Research Center, The Citizenship Lab from OCT 2022 - PRESENT
  - Finding data on soy extractivism and the economic and environmental impacts to map and visualize biocultural citizenship and soy extractivism from Argentina to China.
  - Documenting zones of participation and community encounters with the Casa Rio team and Innovating different ways the community rebuilds areas negatively impacted by deforestation.
+ Research Assistant at Duke University Dept. of Art, Art History and Visual Studies, Durham, NC (Undergraduate Fellow) from JUN 2022 - AUG 2022
  - JCSU Black Neighborhood VR Project:
    - Used ArcGIS Pro to georeference data for a historical Black neighborhood in Charlotte that was removed because of urban development in the mid-20th century.
    - Used SketchUp to create architectural 3D rendered models of specific buildings (Thad Tate's House, Savoy Theater, Hotel Alexander and more) with the understanding from local Charlotte residents’ experiences and Adobe Photoshop to create templates of Story Maps of Black Charlotte.
