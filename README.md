## Bio:
#### hey all! I'm Chloe, junior undergraduate from Duke University and Duke Kunshan University where I study Computation and #Design/Urban Design. I spent a year at Duke in NC and a semester in Barcelona where I studied Architecture. 
# I'm drawn to the relationship between urban planning/architecture and the natural environment and how it impacts the #people around it. All things aesthetics, urbanism, and accessibility.
