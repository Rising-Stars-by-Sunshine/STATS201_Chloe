+ Project Summary
  - Public transportation is a means of connecting us to where we need to be and whoever we need to see. It connects me to my job in the city or my sister in a different state. Public transportation is typically characterized as an accessible and affordable way of traveling from one destination to another. And, when we think of the United States of America, we think of the diverse terrain and people that come with their own unique needs and specifications. In a coastal city, it may be easier to travel via bridge or ferry, or for a person with a wheelchair to have a ramp access to a subway station. These little things make up public transportation in America. How can we analyze the little things, the social and environmental factors, that make up public transportation today to improve the system? This project seeks to use a Poisson regression analysis to determine the relationship between these factors and the choice of taking public transportation for those with disabilities. The main research question being; What are the complex relationships of social and environmental factors influencing the decision-making process of individuals with disabilities in participating in public transportation? And, how can we use this relationship to our advantage as urban planners? The main data sources include the [United States Transportation Bureau](https://data.bts.gov/Research-and-Statistics/County-Transportation-Profiles/qdmf-cxm3) , the [United States Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/table?q=disability&t=Transportation&tid=ACSSPP1Y2021.S020), and the [UCLA Gerontology Study](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/PJWWOC). These scenarios I apply the social and environmental variables and their relationship through regression. Methodology involves a Poisson Regression model in R and a Quasi-Poisson model to verify my results. The results conclude that there is a significant relationship between infrastructure and the need for social interaction to motivate one’s decision to participate in public transportation. This model applies a new way of approaching data from the United States government as a means to improve urban planning by understanding relationships between decisions and various different factors. Urban planners and architects can take away from this research the important relationships to focus on when determining the use of space to increase the range of accessibility to more people.

### Title: Public Transport Policy Measures for Improving Elderly Mobility
Wong, R. C. P., W. Y. Szeto, Linchuan Yang, Y. C. Li, and S. C. Wong. "Public transport policy measures for improving elderly mobility." Transport Policy 63 (2018): 73-79.
1.
Background
The aging population is a global phenomenon that presents significant challenges to urban planners and policymakers, particularly in the context of public transportation. In Public Transport Policy Measures for Improving Elderly Mobility, Wong et al. underscore the growing demographic shift towards an elderly population in metropolitan areas. This paper emphasizes that an increasing proportion of elderly adults in urban areas have substantial transport issues due to the inadequacy of public transport services preventing their mobility (Wong, 2). The primary motivation behind this research is to address the unique transportation needs and challenges facing the elderly in densely populated urban environments like Hong Kong.
Research Question:
The central research question of this study is to investigate the factors influencing the travel decisions of elderly individuals when using public transport to attend social activities in Hong Kong. The authors aim to identify whether factors beyond public transport concession fare schemes, such as walking distance to and from stops and stations, wait times for public transport services, and seat availability, significantly influence the travel decisions of the elderly (Wong, 5).
Application Scenarios:
Interviews with 613 elderly Hong Kong residents aged 60 or above who were required to make travel decisions in four hypothetical game scenarios were conducted in this sentence(Wong, 6). By simulating these scenarios, the research seeks to provide insights into the choices made by elderly individuals when using public transportation for social activities. The findings are particularly relevant for public transport planners and policymakers in Hong Kong and offer valuable guidance to similar metropolitan cities grappling with the challenges of an aging population and public transport service provision.
Methodology:
To address the research question, the authors collected 2452 observations by interviewing elderly residents in Hong Kong. Binary logistic regression models were conducted to determine which factors significantly influenced the travel decisions of the elderly in the context of attending social activities (Wong, 6). This method allowed the researchers to identify the key variables that play a crucial role in shaping the mobility choices of the elderly population.
Results:
As a result, the study revealed that factors other than fare schemes, such as walking distance to and from stops and stations, wait times for public transport services, and seat availability, significantly influence the travel decisions of elderly individuals. This finding underscores the importance of considering these additional factors in public transport planning for the elderly in densely populated urban areas (Wong, 7). These are valuable insights into the complex decision-making processes of elderly individuals when choosing to use public transport for social activities.
Intellectual Merits and Practical Impacts:
This research holds intellectual merit in shedding light on the various factors influencing elderly mobility decisions in public transport use. The study's practical impacts are significant, as it suggests policy measures to enhance public transport planning in Hong Kong by improving elderly mobility. The research findings offer a valuable reference for policymakers and public transport operators not only in Hong Kong but also in other metropolitan cities worldwide grappling with similar traffic conditions and demographic shifts. If factors such as walking distance, wait times, and seat availability are considered, public transport services will better cater to the needs of the elderly and their participation in social activities will improve, resulting in better overall quality of life.

### Title: A Data-Informed Analytical Approach to Human-Scale Greenway Planning: Integrating Multi-Sourced Urban Data with Machine Learning Algorithms
Summary:
Tang, Ziyi, Yu Ye, Zhidian Jiang, Chaowei Fu, Rong Huang, and Dong Yao. "A data-informed analytical approach to human-scale greenway planning: Integrating multi-sourced urban data with machine learning algorithms." Urban Forestry & Urban Greening 56 (2020): 126871. 
The paper authored by Tang et al. introduces an innovative approach to urban greenway planning, aiming to enhance human-scale quality in densely built environments. While urban greenways are widely recognized for their potential to improve urban living conditions, existing greenway suitability analysis predominantly concentrates on geographical and natural aspects, often neglecting essential human-scale urban design factors. In response to this gap, the study presents a data-informed methodology for planning urban greenway networks, leveraging classical urban design theories, multi-sourced urban data, and machine learning algorithms. The authors use Maoming City in China as a case study to demonstrate the practical application of their approach. The research incorporates classical urban design theories, specifically Cervero and Ewing's 5D variables, which encompass density, diversity, design, dimensions of destination accessibility, and distance to transit. These factors are identified as critical for greenway planning to ensure that the resulting networks are not only ecologically sound but also cater to human-scale urban living (Tang, 3). To operationalize their approach, the authors employ a variety of new urban data sources, including points of interest (PoIs), location-based service (LBS) positioning data, and street view images. These datasets are combined with cutting-edge machine learning algorithms and geographical information system (GIS) tools to assess the factors at a granular, human-scale resolution (Tang, 3). The objective is to create an optimized greenway suitability analysis that is sensitive to the needs of urban residents. The innovative aspect of this research lies in its integration of classical urban design principles with state-of-the-art data sources and machine-learning techniques. This approach transcends traditional greenway planning by providing a holistic understanding of urban design factors and their real-world implications. Furthermore, it extends the methodological boundaries of greenway planning, emphasizing the importance of incorporating human-scale concerns on a city-wide scale to create more effective greenway networks.
Tang et al.'s paper holds significant relevance in the machine-learning sphere. By utilizing machine learning algorithms in conjunction with multi-sourced urban data, the study exemplifies how advanced data-driven techniques can be used for urban planning and design. The integration of machine learning in assessing urban greenway suitability amplifies the potential of AI-driven approaches to address complex urban challenges. This work not only showcases the practical application of machine learning in urban planning but also demonstrates how it can enhance the quality of life for urban residents by facilitating the creation of green spaces that align with human-scale needs and preferences. As such, this paper provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners interested in the intersection of machine learning, urban planning, and human-centered design.
To me, this paper was particularly fascinating as an aspiring urban planner because it innovated technology. The use of technology for green urban design is something so futuristic to me and makes me hopeful for the direction of our future.

## Method
3.1     Research Question Formulation
The focal research inquiry guiding the study of public transportation disability access is as follows: What are the complex relationships of social and environmental factors influencing the decision-making process of individuals with disabilities in participating in public transportation? Furthermore, predicated on these determined factors, how can the enhancement of the accessibility of American public transportation for individuals with disabilities be conceptualized and operationalized?
An imperative facet in urban planning lies in the nuanced evaluation of determinants impacting decision-making, particularly in the realm of city planning and public transportation. As posited by Field (2007), the overarching objective is to meticulously craft urban environments that afford optimal accessibility to resources for all citizens. By scrutinizing demographics characterized by underrepresentation, notably individuals with disabilities, an enhanced understanding can be cultivated, thereby facilitating targeted modifications to infrastructure and policy, ensuring inclusivity in civic amenities.
The independent variable (X) encapsulates the disability status of individuals in the United States, while the dependent variables (Y) encompass the chosen modes of transportation, including public transportation, private vehicle conveyance, or remote telecommuting.
The research design adopts a cross-sectional methodology, with a prospective expansion towards a time-series framework. This envisaged temporal extension aims to compare disparate temporal points, specifically pre- and post-COVID periods or variations across distinct geographical regions.
It is hypothesized that there exists a substantiated correlation between the modes of transportation chosen and an individual's disability status. This is because, individuals with disabilities are subject to exhibit a preference for personalized modes of transportation, such as private vehicle conveyance or remote work arrangements. This inclination arises from the conjecture that the existing infrastructure of American public transportation inadequately accommodates the diverse spectrum of physical and/or mental impairments, thereby steering preferences towards more individually tailored transportation alternatives.

3.2     Application of Machine Learning Algorithm
The envisaged analytical approach involves the deployment of a Poisson Regression model and a CoxPH Regression model (UCLA, 2023), specifically tailored for the temporal analysis inherent in the time-series dimension. These methodologies are anticipated to yield insights into the dynamic associations between disability status and chosen transportation modes over varying temporal intervals. Alternative machine learning algorithms for my categorical data to analyze social science are often typical regression models to the data, but the poisson model is more specific in terms of my categorical data. It is possible to apply a hazard model or time series machine learning algorithm to the data however, the current research is using a categorical regression analysis.

I will initiate the data acquisition process by extracting information from the census API through the tidycensus R package (Walker, 2023.) To ensure statistical robustness, a preliminary step involves conducting random sampling, thereby enhancing the dataset's representativeness. Subsequently, the integration of graphical and tabular representation methods, such as correlation plots, will be employed to effectively elucidate the interplay between variables.

3.3     Presentation of Results
The dichotomy between training and testing will be manifested through graphical representations and regression model tables. The training phase will be executed on an earlier temporal epoch, where the inherent relationships between variables may exhibit heightened salience. The subsequent testing phase will be extended to more recent years, providing a nuanced evaluation of the model's adaptability. Furthermore, diversification in testing will be achieved through experimentation with different census packages.
Resultant insights will be communicated through a diverse array of graphical depictions, each tailored to underscore distinctive facets of the relationship between variables. This may include graphs featuring fitted and predicted values, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of the model's predictive capabilities. I will employ a data table with the results of the regression and scatter plots with the relationships between the fitted and residual values. As well as, line graphs to describe my summary statistics behind the data points themselves. Similar to the presentation I have created before on Hazard Models in R and the County transportation dataset, I will be displaying the residual plot and variable analysis graphs like the following:

3.4     Model Evaluation
The assessment of regression model performance in R will be underpinned by a multi-metric approach. The Mean Squared Error (MSE), a fundamental metric quantifying the average squared difference between predicted and actual values, will serve as a pivotal benchmark (“R: Extract Mean Squared Error (MSE) from Fitted Regression Model”). Lower MSE values are indicative of heightened model precision. Additionally, the R-squared (R²) statistic will offer insights into the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the model, with a higher R² denoting a superior fit. Supplementary metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and diagnostic plots like residual plots, will be incorporated to holistically evaluate the model's predictive accuracy and its generalizability within the R programming context. The way I will train and split the data is by first (training) generating a series of random noise and data points based off of the existing data in order to test the results on my dataset regarding the infrastructure data and comparing it to my test data which is the main component of my analysis with my regression model.
In pursuit of refinement, two distinctive strategies will be explored. Firstly, a shift towards a time-series regression framework will be undertaken, facilitating a comparative analysis across different temporal epochs. Simultaneously, an exhaustive search for new variables will be conducted, aiming to unearth latent relationships that might enhance the model's predictive efficacy.

## Data
The dataset under investigation encompasses County Transportation Profiles sourced from diverse counties across the United States, as compiled and disseminated by the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS). These profiles offer a comprehensive overview of transportation dynamics within each county, providing a rich repository of information crucial for understanding the multifaceted landscape of public transit.
The dataset, encapsulated in the CSV file named "County_Transportation_Profiles.csv," includes an extensive array of variables elucidating the intricate tapestry of transportation infrastructure and dynamics. Encompassing not only fundamental aspects of public transit but also delving into various environmental factors, this dataset presents a holistic perspective on the interplay between county-specific characteristics and transportation modalities.
The primary source of this dataset is the BTS Data Inventory, with the specific dataset named "County Transportation Profiles" (BTS, 2023). This dataset proves to be an invaluable asset for both researchers and practitioners, enabling a thorough investigation into the nuances of transportation trends and patterns specific to county-level dynamics.

Data Query Process (Code in GitHub in Queried data folder)

The provided R code outlines a data query process using the `censusapi` package to extract demographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS). First, the code installs and loads the `censusapi` package. An API key is then specified and inserted to authorize access to Census data. The query parameters, including the API endpoint (ACS in this case) and the desired variable (total population represented by "B01003_001E"), are defined. The geographic scope is set to a census tract within a specific state (New York, represented by the state code "36") and county (Kings County, represented by the county code "081"). The actual API call is made using the `getCensus` function, extracting the specified variables for the defined geography and vintage year (2019). The result, containing population data for the specified census tract, is stored in the variable `census_data`, which is then printed to display the retrieved information. This process demonstrates how to leverage the `censusapi` package to efficiently fetch demographic data from the U.S. Census Bureau's API for further analysis or visualization.

## Results
The research question aims to investigate the intricate interplays of social and environmental factors that influence the decision-making process of individuals with disabilities in selecting public transportation. Additionally, the study seeks to conceptualize and operationalize enhancements to the accessibility of American public transportation for individuals with disabilities based on the discerned factors. The research project adopts a structured approach using Poisson Regression and CoxPH Regression models to analyze temporal and regional variations. These machine learning algorithms are chosen for their suitability in investigating complex relationships between disability status and transportation choices over time and across different geographic contexts. The data employed in the study includes disability status as the independent variable (X) and chosen transportation modes (public transportation, personal vehicle, remote work) as the dependent variables (Y). Initially cross-sectional, the data aims to explore potential temporal variations by comparing different years (pre and post-COVID) or diverse regions. The prediction hypothesis posits a significant influence of disability status on transportation choices, suggesting that individuals with disabilities may exhibit a preference for personal transportation modes or remote work due to inadequacies in the infrastructure supporting various disabilities within the American public transportation system. In short, the research project leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze the relationships between disability status and transportation choices, aiming to identify the factors influencing decision-making processes and proposing enhancements for the accessibility of public transportation for individuals with disabilities. The structured approach and prediction hypothesis provide a framework for a comprehensive investigation into the complex interplay of social and environmental factors in this context.

## Spotlight
After taking STATS201: Machine Learning for Social Science with Professor Luyao Zhang, I believe I could understand how machine learning research, especially papers, have evolved over time. Throughout history, the necessary tools for improving machine learning have increased over time. This class taught me the various methods and processes that are the foundation behind the significant papers won by Turing awards or featured by Microsoft. That’s where I think the magic of interdisciplinary research can be seen, it's where the unthinkable happens. Where research about anything regarding society and people can technology, machine learning, artificial intelligence and more can be applied to. Something you wouldn’t think would be helpful to understanding a concept turns out to be the thing that advances research in that field. 
This course has also taught me to come up with my own ideas for each step of the research paper process. From ideation to writing the proposal, my self-reliance has sharpened and I gained a lot of freedom. It also helped me with connecting with other researchers like my peers, giving and taking useful feedback with presentations and group work. I learned the importance of being able to learn from myself and one another.
contribution do you want to make to your self-fulfillment and to advancing human civilization? 
I am inspired to be the founding father of self-regenerating cities. The concept of metabolism in the urban sphere has been around for a long time. I want to take this step further and apply machine learning and artificial intelligence to create technology to have cities be able to rebuild themselves and adapt to new environments as climate change continues to change terrains across the world. My feature sentence being: I created the cities of tomorrow. 

## More about the Author
### Bio:
hey all! I'm Chloe, junior undergraduate from Duke University and Duke Kunshan University where I study Computation and Design/Urban Design. I spent a year at Duke in NC and a semester in Barcelona where I studied Architecture. 
I'm drawn to the relationship between urban planning/architecture and the natural environment and how it impacts the people around it. All things aesthetics, urbanism, and accessibility.
