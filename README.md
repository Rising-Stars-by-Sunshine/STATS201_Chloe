+ Project Summary
  - Public transportation is a means of connecting us to where we need to be and whoever we need to see. It connects me to my job in the city or my sister in a different state. Public transportation is typically characterized as an accessible and affordable way of traveling from one destination to another. And, when we think of the United States of America, we think of the diverse terrain and people that come with their own unique needs and specifications. In a coastal city, it may be easier to travel via bridge or ferry, or for a person with a wheelchair to have a ramp access to a subway station. These little things make up public transportation in America. How can we analyze the little things, the social and environmental factors, that make up public transportation today to improve the system? This project seeks to use a Poisson regression analysis to determine the relationship between these factors and the choice of taking public transportation for those with disabilities. The main research question being; What are the complex relationships of social and environmental factors influencing the decision-making process of individuals with disabilities in participating in public transportation? And, how can we use this relationship to our advantage as urban planners? The main data sources include the [United States Transportation Bureau](https://data.bts.gov/Research-and-Statistics/County-Transportation-Profiles/qdmf-cxm3) , the [United States Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/table?q=disability&t=Transportation&tid=ACSSPP1Y2021.S020), and the [UCLA Gerontology Study](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/PJWWOC). These scenarios I apply the social and environmental variables and their relationship through regression. Methodology involves a Poisson Regression model in R and a Quasi-Poisson model to verify my results. The results conclude that there is a significant relationship between infrastructure and the need for social interaction to motivate one’s decision to participate in public transportation. This model applies a new way of approaching data from the United States government as a means to improve urban planning by understanding relationships between decisions and various different factors. Urban planners and architects can take away from this research the important relationships to focus on when determining the use of space to increase the range of accessibility to more people.

## Method
3.1     Research Question Formulation
The focal research inquiry guiding the study of public transportation disability access is as follows: What are the complex relationships of social and environmental factors influencing the decision-making process of individuals with disabilities in participating in public transportation? Furthermore, predicated on these determined factors, how can the enhancement of the accessibility of American public transportation for individuals with disabilities be conceptualized and operationalized?
An imperative facet in urban planning lies in the nuanced evaluation of determinants impacting decision-making, particularly in the realm of city planning and public transportation. As posited by Field (2007), the overarching objective is to meticulously craft urban environments that afford optimal accessibility to resources for all citizens. By scrutinizing demographics characterized by underrepresentation, notably individuals with disabilities, an enhanced understanding can be cultivated, thereby facilitating targeted modifications to infrastructure and policy, ensuring inclusivity in civic amenities.
The independent variable (X) encapsulates the disability status of individuals in the United States, while the dependent variables (Y) encompass the chosen modes of transportation, including public transportation, private vehicle conveyance, or remote telecommuting.
The research design adopts a cross-sectional methodology, with a prospective expansion towards a time-series framework. This envisaged temporal extension aims to compare disparate temporal points, specifically pre- and post-COVID periods or variations across distinct geographical regions.
It is hypothesized that there exists a substantiated correlation between the modes of transportation chosen and an individual's disability status. This is because, individuals with disabilities are subject to exhibit a preference for personalized modes of transportation, such as private vehicle conveyance or remote work arrangements. This inclination arises from the conjecture that the existing infrastructure of American public transportation inadequately accommodates the diverse spectrum of physical and/or mental impairments, thereby steering preferences towards more individually tailored transportation alternatives.

3.2     Application of Machine Learning Algorithm
The envisaged analytical approach involves the deployment of a Poisson Regression model and a CoxPH Regression model, specifically tailored for the temporal analysis inherent in the time-series dimension. These methodologies are anticipated to yield insights into the dynamic associations between disability status and chosen transportation modes over varying temporal intervals.
I will initiate the data acquisition process by extracting information from the census API through the tidycensus R package. To ensure statistical robustness, a preliminary step involves conducting random sampling, thereby enhancing the dataset's representativeness. Subsequently, the integration of graphical and tabular representation methods, such as correlation plots, will be employed to effectively elucidate the interplay between variables.

3.3     Presentation of Results
The dichotomy between training and testing will be manifested through graphical representations and regression model tables. The training phase will be executed on an earlier temporal epoch, where the inherent relationships between variables may exhibit heightened salience. The subsequent testing phase will be extended to more recent years, providing a nuanced evaluation of the model's adaptability. Furthermore, diversification in testing will be achieved through experimentation with different census packages.
Resultant insights will be communicated through a diverse array of graphical depictions, each tailored to underscore distinctive facets of the relationship between variables. This may include graphs featuring fitted and predicted values, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of the model's predictive capabilities. Similar to the presentation I have created before on Hazard Models in R and the County transportation dataset, I will be displaying the residual plot and variable analysis graphs like the following:

3.4     Model Evaluation
The assessment of regression model performance in R will be underpinned by a multi-metric approach. The Mean Squared Error (MSE), a fundamental metric quantifying the average squared difference between predicted and actual values, will serve as a pivotal benchmark (“R: Extract Mean Squared Error (MSE) from Fitted Regression Model”). Lower MSE values are indicative of heightened model precision. Additionally, the R-squared (R²) statistic will offer insights into the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the model, with a higher R² denoting a superior fit. Supplementary metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and diagnostic plots like residual plots, will be incorporated to holistically evaluate the model's predictive accuracy and its generalizability within the R programming context.
In pursuit of refinement, two distinctive strategies will be explored. Firstly, a shift towards a time-series regression framework will be undertaken, facilitating a comparative analysis across different temporal epochs. Simultaneously, an exhaustive search for new variables will be conducted, aiming to unearth latent relationships that might enhance the model's predictive efficacy.

## Data
The dataset under investigation encompasses County Transportation Profiles sourced from diverse counties across the United States, as compiled and disseminated by the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS). These profiles offer a comprehensive overview of transportation dynamics within each county, providing a rich repository of information crucial for understanding the multifaceted landscape of public transit.
The dataset, encapsulated in the CSV file named "County_Transportation_Profiles.csv," includes an extensive array of variables elucidating the intricate tapestry of transportation infrastructure and dynamics. Encompassing not only fundamental aspects of public transit but also delving into various environmental factors, this dataset presents a holistic perspective on the interplay between county-specific characteristics and transportation modalities.
The primary source of this dataset is the BTS Data Inventory, with the specific dataset named "County Transportation Profiles" (BTS, 2023). This dataset proves to be an invaluable asset for both researchers and practitioners, enabling a thorough investigation into the nuances of transportation trends and patterns specific to county-level dynamics.

Data Query Process (Code in GitHub in Queried data folder)

The provided R code outlines a data query process using the `censusapi` package to extract demographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS). First, the code installs and loads the `censusapi` package. An API key is then specified and inserted to authorize access to Census data. The query parameters, including the API endpoint (ACS in this case) and the desired variable (total population represented by "B01003_001E"), are defined. The geographic scope is set to a census tract within a specific state (New York, represented by the state code "36") and county (Kings County, represented by the county code "081"). The actual API call is made using the `getCensus` function, extracting the specified variables for the defined geography and vintage year (2019). The result, containing population data for the specified census tract, is stored in the variable `census_data`, which is then printed to display the retrieved information. This process demonstrates how to leverage the `censusapi` package to efficiently fetch demographic data from the U.S. Census Bureau's API for further analysis or visualization.
