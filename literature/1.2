Research Idea:

Background/motivation:
Today, there are 1 in 4 American adults that have a disability (CDC, 2023). As the general population grows within the United States, it is imperative that necessary and proper infrastructure should accommodate the needs of those with disabilities. So, how can our infrastructure of today adapt? For those attempting to commute across America’s diverse terrain, transportation can be a difficult journey. One solution is to evaluate the different types of factors that involve those with disabilities in their decision-making when it comes to public transportation. 

Research questions:
What are the various factors that contribute to people with disabilities making decisions on public transportation? Based on the various environmental and social factors, how can we enhance their accessibility?

Application scenarios: 
	I hopefully seek to apply this scenario through a case study. I want to evaluate the decisions and opinions of adults (including those with disabilities) in a specific population, preferably Los Angeles, in order to continue my research with elderly and public transportation.

Methodology:
	In order to apply the scenario above, I hope to use the U.S. Census Bureau’s data on county transportation profiles and then filter the population to Los Angeles counties. In combination with a population survey from the U.S. Census or another government body. From there, I hope to continue the research and conduct a multinomial regression model in R. Regressing different social and environmental factors such as satisfaction with public transport and the number of bus stops on the decision to take public transportation.

Results:
	As a result, I hope to identify the social and environmental factors that have a significant impact on the decision to take public transportation for those with disabilities. That way, I can propose to local policymakers and urban planners with different solutions on how to improve public transportation in the United States for those with disabilities. 

Intellectual merits/practical impacts:
This research aims to educate others on the various factors that contribute to adequate public transportation for an underrepresented population, those with disabilities. From identifying these factors, I can develop specific solutions based on the problems, helping local governments to consider the underrepresented in infrastructure and decision making.
